# Git Demo

This repository is used to demonstrate and practice Git commands.

## Step 1

The commands below are used to submit changes from your local repository to the
origin. Add in the arguments for the commands and use them to push changes.

```
git add <file-name>
git commit -m "Message for the commit"
git push <upstream> <branch> //git push origin master
```

## Step 2

When ready, update your local repository with the instructions for Step 3 by
pulling from the forked repo with the following commands.

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/WillBAnders/GitDemo
git pull upstream
```
